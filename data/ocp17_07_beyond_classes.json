            	"explanation": "Iguana does not compile, as it declares a static field with the same name as an instance field. Records are implicitly final and cannot be marked abstract, which is why Gecko compiles and Chameleon does not, making option B correct. Notice in Gecko that records are not required to declare any fields. BeardedDragon also compiles, as records may override any accessor methods, making option D correct. Newt does not compile because records are immutable, so any mutator methods that modify fields are not permitted. Overriding the equals() method is allowed, though."

The method declaration is valid, making option F incorrect, although it does not satisfy the abstract method requirement inherited from HasExoskeleton.
