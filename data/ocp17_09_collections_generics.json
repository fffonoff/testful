Option A is a better answer than option D because LinkedList is both a List and a Queue, and you just need a regular List. For the second scenario, the answer needs to implement Map because you are dealing with key/value pairs per the unique id field. This narrows it down to options B and E. Since the question talks about ordering, you need the TreeMap. Therefore, the answer is option E."

While the println() method takes a generic parameter of type T, it is not the same <T> defined for the class on line 1. Instead, it is a different T defined as part of the method declaration on line 3. Therefore, the String argument on line 7 applies only to the class. The method can take any object as a parameter, including autoboxed primitives. Line 8 creates the Hello class with the generic type Object since no type is specified for that instance. It passes a boolean to println(), which gets autoboxed into a Boolean. The result is that hi-1hola-true is printed, making option B correct."

Option E is incorrect because there is no thenComparingNumber() method. Option B is a correct answer, as it sorts by beakLength in descending order. Options D and F are trickier. First, notice that we can call either thenComparing() or thenComparingInt() because the former will simply autobox the int into an Integer. Then observe what reversed() applies to. Option D is incorrect because it sorts by name in ascending order and only reverses the beak length of those with the same name. Option F creates a comparator that sorts by name in ascending order and then by beak size in ascending order. Finally, it reverses the result. This is just what we want, so option F is correct."
