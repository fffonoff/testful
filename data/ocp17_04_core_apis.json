Therefore, we use numeric addition and get 5. The problem is that we can't store an int in a String variable. Suppose line 5 said String anotherFish = numFish + 1 + \"\";. In that case, the answers would be option A and option C. The variable defined on line 5 would be the string \"5\", and both output statements would use concatenation."

The character at index 3 is 5, making option B correct. Option C is similar, making the intermediate value 126 and returning 6. Option D results in an exception since there is no character at index 5. Option E is incorrect. It does not compile because the parentheses for the length() method are missing.

The second takes just the index to start with and goes to the end of the String. Remember that indexes are zero-based. The first call starts at index 1 and ends with index 2 since it needs to stop before index 3. This gives us option A.

The indent() method adds two characters to the beginning of each of the two lines of base. This gives us four additional characters. However, the method also normalizes by adding a new line to the end if it is missing. The extra character means we add five characters to the existing 11, which is option G. Finally, the translateEscapes() method turns any text escape characters into actual escape characters, making \\\\t into \\t.

Finally, on line 20, something happens. We concatenate three new characters to s1 and now have a String of length 7, making option C correct. Next, s2 += 2 expands to s2 = s2 + 2. A String concatenated with any other type gives a String. Lines 22, 23, and 24 all append to s2, giving a result of \"2cfalse\". The if statement on line 27 returns true because the values of the two String objects are the same using object equality. The if statement on line 26 returns false because the two String objects are not the same in memory.
