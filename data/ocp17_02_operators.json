Options B and C are both arithmetic operators and cannot be applied to a boolean value. Option D is the logical complement operator and is used exclusively with boolean values. Option E is the modulus operator, which can be used only with numeric primitives. Option F is a bitwise complement operator and can only be applied to integer values. Finally, option G is correct, as you can cast a boolean variable since boolean is a type."

            	"explanation": "The code does not compile because line 3 contains a compilation error. The cast (int) is applied to fruit, not the expression fruit+vegetables. Since the cast operator has a higher operator precedence than the addition operator, it is applied to fruit, but the expression is promoted to a float, due to vegetables being float. The result cannot be returned as long in the addCandy() method without a cast. For this reason, option F is correct. If parentheses were added around fruit+vegetables, then the output would be 3, 5, 6, and option B would be correct. Remember that casting floating-point numbers to integral values results in truncation, not rounding."

            	"explanation": "In the first boolean expression, vis is 2 and ph is 7, so this expression evaluates to true & (true || false), which reduces to true. The second boolean expression uses the conditional operator, and since (vis > 2) is false, the right side is not evaluated, leaving ph at 7. In the last assignment, ph is 7, and the pre-decrement operator is applied first, reducing the expression to 7 <= 6 and resulting in an assignment of false. For these reasons, option D is the correct answer."

Line 5 increments pig by 1, but it returns the original value of 4 since it is using the post-increment operator. The pig variable is then assigned this value, and the increment operation is discarded.

In the first expression, a > 2 is false, so b is incremented to 5; but since the post-increment operator is used, 4 is printed, making option D correct. The --c was not applied, because only one of the right-hand expressions was evaluated. In the second expression, a!=c is false since c was never modified. Since b is 5 due to the previous line and the post-increment operator is used, b++ returns 5. The result is then assigned to b using the assignment operator, overriding the incremented value for b and printing 5, making option E correct. In the last expression, parentheses are not required, but lack of parentheses can make ternary expressions difficult to read. From the previous lines, a is 2, b is 5, and c is 2. We can rewrite this expression with parentheses as (2 > 5 ? (5 < 2 ? 5 : 2) : 1). The second ternary expression is never evaluated since 2 > 5 is false, and the expression returns 1, making option A correct."

For this reason, option A is incorrect, and option E is correct. Option B is correct, as the equality (==) and inequality (!=) operators can both be used with objects. Option C is incorrect, as boolean and numeric types are not comparable. For example, you can't say true == 3 without a compilation error. Option D is incorrect, as logical operators evaluate both sides of the expression. The (|) operator will cause both sides to be evaluated. Option F is incorrect, as Java does not accept numbers for boolean values. Finally, option G is correct, as you need to use the negation operator (-) to flip or negate numeric values, not the logical complement operator (!)."
