The variable is processed using deferred execution in the testLaugh() method. Options B and E are incorrect; since the local variable age is not effectively final, this would lead to a compilation error. Option C would also cause a compilation error, since the expression uses the variable name p, which is already declared within the method.

Transport and Boat are valid functional interfaces, as they each contain a single abstract method: go() and hashCode(String), respectively. This gives us options A and E. Since the other methods are part of Object, they do not count as abstract methods. Train is also a functional interface since it extends Transport and does not define any additional abstract methods. This adds option F as the final correct answer. Car is not a functional interface because it is an abstract class. Locomotive is not a functional interface because it includes two abstract methods, one of which is inherited. Finally, Spaceship is not a valid interface, let alone a functional interface, because a default method must provide a body. A quick way to test whether an interface is a functional interface is to apply the @FunctionalInterface annotation and check if the code still compiles."
