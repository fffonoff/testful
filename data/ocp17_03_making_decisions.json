Option B is correct and will print the elements in order. Option C doesn't compile as i is undefined in weather[i]. For this to work, the body of the for-each loop would have to be updated as well. Option D is also correct and is a common way to print the elements of an array in reverse order. Option E does not compile and is therefore incorrect. You can declare multiple elements in a for loop, but the data type must be listed only once, such as in for(int i=0, j=3; …). Finally, option F is incorrect because the first element of the array is skipped. Since the conditional expression is checked before the loop is executed the first time, the first value of i used inside the body of the loop will be 1."

Note that options E and F are equivalent to options B and D, respectively, since unlabeled statements apply to the most inner loop. Studying the loops, the first time the condition is true is in the second iteration of the inner loop, when row is 1 and col is 1. Option A is incorrect because this causes the loop to exit immediately with count only being set to 1. Options B, C, and E follow the same pathway. First, count is incremented to 1 on the first inner loop, and then the inner loop is exited. On the next iteration of the outer loop, row is 2 and col is 0, so execution exits the inner loop immediately. On the third iteration of the outer loop, row is 3 and col is 0, so count is incremented to 2. In the next iteration of the inner loop, the sum is even, so we exit, and our program is complete, making options B, C, and E each correct. Options D and F are both incorrect, as they cause the inner and outer loops to execute multiple times, with count having a value of 5 when done. You don't need to trace through all the iterations; just stop when the value of count exceeds 2."

For option B, the first continue on line 8 causes the execution to skip the innermost loop on the first iteration of the second loop but not the second iteration of the second loop. The innermost loop is executed, and with continue on line 12, it produces an infinite loop at runtime, making option B incorrect. Option C is incorrect because it contains a compiler error. The label L3 is not visible outside its loop. Option D is incorrect, as it is equivalent to option B since the unlabeled break and continue apply to the nearest loop and therefore produce an infinite loop at runtime. Like option A, the continue L2 on line 8 allows the innermost loop to be executed the second time the second loop is called. The continue L2 on line 12 exits the infinite loop, though, causing control to return to the second loop.
