The variable b1 is set to false because Java finds an element that matches when it gets to the element of length 4. However, the next line tries to operate on the same stream.

These options all have much in common. All of them start out with a LongStream and attempt to convert it to an IntStream. However, options B and E are incorrect because they do not cast the long to an int, resulting in a compiler error on the mapToInt() calls. Next, we hit the second difference. Options A and D are incorrect because they are missing boxed() before the collect() call. Since groupingBy() is creating a Collection, we need a nonprimitive Stream. The final difference is that option F specifies the type of Collection. This is allowed, though, meaning both options C and F are correct."

The pipeline preserves only nonempty elements on line 25. Since there aren't any of those, the pipeline is empty. Line 26 converts this to an empty map. Lines 27 and 28 create a Set with no elements and then another empty stream. Lines 29 and 30 convert the generic type of the Stream to List<String> and then String. Finally, line 31 gives us another Map<Boolean, List<String>>. The partitioningBy() operation always returns a map with two Boolean keys, even if there are no corresponding values. Therefore, option B is correct if the code is kept as is. By contrast, groupingBy() returns only keys that are actually needed, making option C correct if the code is modified on line 31."
